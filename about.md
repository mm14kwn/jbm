The Journal of Byrnian Mechanics was born out of a number of sessions of PhD students answering maths and physics questions for first year geography students. In between questions, the demonstrators would try to work out the physics of increasingly ridiculous scenarios, eventually planning to publish the work in the "Journal of Byrnian Mechanics", named for one of the PhD students who made the biggest leaps in justification. Send us a question at jbyrnianmechanics@gmail.com, and we'll try to answer!
