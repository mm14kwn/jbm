The Journal of Byrnian Mechanics was an idea dreamt up by two Ph.D. students at the University of Liverpool to record the strange "what-if" scientific questions they came up with while they were meant to be helping a class of first years learn basic maths and physics. We are entirely aware that [XKCD] [http://what-if.xkcd.com] has already done this, much better than we could ever hope for.
