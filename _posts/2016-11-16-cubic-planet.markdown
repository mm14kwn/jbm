The original question, the one that launched the journal.

A couple of small problems, however, firstly, I've forgotten most of what we worked out, and secondly, when I looked it up to try remember, I found someone has already written a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3857.pdf) on it. I'll try and summarise it here, then see if we can work out the situation for other planets.

We can work out a really simple approximation at first by thinking of a point mass, and our position on a cube around that mass. Wheras on a spherical planet, our distance would be constant, here it will vary between corners, edges and the centre of faces. The gravitational accelleration at distance $$r$$ from a point mass $$M$$ is given by $$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$, and if we stick on the surface of a cube, $$r=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$$. This means we have $$g=\frac{GM}{x^2 +y^2 +z^2}$$. Plotting this for a unit cube and unit mass, we have the following map of varying $$g$$:
