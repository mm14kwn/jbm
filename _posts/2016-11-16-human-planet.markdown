What if we took all the humans on Earth, and put them in a ball in space? What would the gravity be like? How about the pressure at the centre?

Morals and logistics aside, this is a relatively simple problem if we make a few assumptions. First, as humans are mostly water, it's reasonable to assume that their density, $$\rho$$, is similar, i.e. $$\rho=1000~\mathrm{kgm^-3}$$. Second, we assume that humans are fundamentally uncompressable, as it makes the maths a lot easier. We could set aside this assumption later, but its reasonable, humans are mostly water, and water can only be compressed a very small amount, and it takes an awful lot of force to do it.

Now we have a density, we could do with finding a mass. In an [article](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/469/art%253A10.1186%252F1471-2458-12-439.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fbmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2F1471-2458-12-439&token2=exp=1479285558~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F469%2Fart%25253A10.1186%25252F1471-2458-12-439.pdf*~hmac=91367edeb913edb72f82b0324539541a1d3fad3c5addc59a7c26768e7e278d34) for BMC Public Health in 2012, Walpole et. al. give an average body mass globally as $$62~\mathrm{kg}$$. Multiplying this by $$7\times 10^9$$ (there are varying numbers for Earth population, and it is obviously growing, so this gives a decent lower bound pretty much everyone aggrees on), we arrive at a total mass of $$4.34\times 10^11~\mathrm{k}g$$. We can then work out the volume all these people would make if we somehow forced them into a sphere, by using the relationship between mass, volume and density $$\rho=\frac{M}{V}$$. This gives a volume of $$4.34\times 10^8~\mathrm{m^3}$$. If this were a uniform sphere, it would have a radius of $$470~\mathrm{m}$$.

We can now work out the pressure at the centre of this sphere, using the Uniform Density Central Pressure Equation (which sounds grander than it is), $$P=(\frac{3\pi}{8})(\frac{GM^2}{R^4})$$, where $$M$$ is the mass, $$R$$ is the radius, and $$G$$ is Newton's gravitational constant. This gives a central pressure of $$303.5~\mathrm{Pascals}$$, or about a third of the atmospheric pressure on Mars!
